/***
 * Mr. Karam.J :
 * 		However, as for ather, when talking about the interfacing provided
 * it is quite simple in a sense.
 * 0 -> ather
 * 1 -> operating sys(linux,macOS,Win{32,64},POSIX-complaint) or any other
 * 2 -> Apache or any other
 * 3 -> ethereum or any other
 * Any peer on 0xather is always aware and in total control of everything that is happening
 * to the system as a whole, however the ather is i-defined; user-defined.
 * Thus, @home is different:
 *  for each 
 * 	1.	person(unique phone,ethereum address,... for example)/ 
 * 	2.	each group of people(unique LAN)/ 
 * 	3.	each collection of groups(unique sub_net)
 * 	4.  each (global ip) 
 * 	5.  each protocol type  
 * @ protocol includes the different machine processes that are
 * being run, including a fantastic signature creating mechanism.
 * that combines any or all the above to form uniqueness which is coupled by a `c struct`
 * enable the protocol to call sockets, open/close files, interrupt processes, process scripts, run shells, etc...
 *
