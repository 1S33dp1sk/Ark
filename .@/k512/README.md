# K-arch512

Whilst Ark redefines programming with a unique approach, designed to tackle common challenges. Coupling the it with community developed libraries brings a new smooth experience to it's implemented features such as:

1. Distributed storage
2. Decentralized networks
3. Customizable executions
4. Default typings/types


##  [**\_\_ark**](./__ark)
	
	Defines the parameters of the Ark language.        
	


## atp
	
	Defines various protocol handling mechanims. Including sending, recieving, switching and serve point initiation and service point replying
	      


## ixr
	
	Defines the current execution file, loads contexts and initializes pointers to handle calls, index integrity, and concurrency effectivily.
	


## lbb
	
	Defines the current main mechanism for reliably creating a distributed database. 
	


### ARK
	
	the starting execution point of the system-build.
	


### __karch__
	
	the basic interface of the machine, including rights, interface levels, debugging, etc..
	


### standard.h
	A list of `unistd` headers or equivalent and `operating-system` determinstic checks. of which associates the object files in this directory to be able to execute files by referencing their matching build systems. **ATP** couples `fields` which are an ARK type, that distributes contents of file with the associated addresses to the network. Comparitivly showing that the redundencies which arise from replicating data on different machines to run binaries might not be the best way of communciation.


### utypes.h
	
	The skeleton and standard system types, based on the types and thier implementations.
	


# \_512.h

The DCN (Definitions-Constants-Names) model.
model-name : `K-arch512d`
