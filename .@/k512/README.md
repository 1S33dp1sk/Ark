## \_\_ark
	
	Defines the language parameters of Ark itself.

## lbb

### ARK
	
	the starting execution point of the system-build.
	

### __karch__
	
	the basic interface of the machine, including rights, interface levels, debugging, etc..
	

### \_512.h
	
	The DCN (Definitions-Constants-Names) model.
	model : `K-arch512d`


### standard.h
	A list of `unistd` headers or equivalent and `operating-system` determinstic checks. of which associates the object files in this directory to be able to execute files by referencing their matching build systems. **ATP** couples `fields` which are an ARK type, that distributes contents of file with the associated addresses to the network. Comparitivly showing that the redundencies which arise from replicating data on different machines to run binaries might not be the best way of communciation.



### utypes.h
	
	The skeleton and standard system types, based on the types and thier implementations.
