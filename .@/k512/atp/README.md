For centralized systems distributed storage and decentralized calls can decrease the probability of SPOFs (single point of failures).
As for decentralized applications and their systems, the distributed storage offers a much lower redundency than replicating entire databases.

The CDN provides the high demand scaling availability. Nonetheless, that availablity is served using the same system that serves the DHCPs, giving the ability to convert addresses quickly but since these calls is single-chained-processes, the loads are much better handled by using multiple hosts each serving instead of a single host serving the entire request batch.
