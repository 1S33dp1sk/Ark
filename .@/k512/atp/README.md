# ATP

With the development and improvements being done frequently on Ark, the protocol went through different stages and changing the purpose, the description, and the symbolic name by orders of magnitude, However, one thing stayed constant and that is the acronym.

- AT-Protocol, it interprets the first character command.   

- Aether Transfer Protocol, it enables the transfer of data across different networks' interfaces including peer-to-peer and dynamic DHCP networks.         

- Ark Terminal Protocol establishes morphism when calls are shaped by **`calls`** thus, *morphed*, into any request by processing a valid protocol name, such as `@LBB` or `@IXR`.     
-  ATP is a poly action into a corresponding pre-defined standard protocol (e.g., HTTP(s) or Ethereum).        



# Why ATP ?

The CDN provides the high demand scaling availability. Nonetheless, that availablity is served using the same system that serves the DHCPs, giving the ability to convert addresses quickly but since these calls is single-chained-processes, the loads are much better handled by using multiple hosts each serving instead of a single host serving the entire request batch.
