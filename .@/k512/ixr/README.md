## 1. Error Handling
    Ark's error handling mechanism uses exit hashes to ensure the reliability of execution threads. 

A file enables a file, a directory enables a directories, and so forth.
Objects and references result in a multi address variable enough to be both useful and secure.
A compiled file program can be done traditionally using `cc` or `gcc`, however to be useful function header exist and thus signatures as well which can be viewed with tools like `nm`



The symbol `&->` implies the lexical equivalent of its counterpart *And Then*. 
    Now *`HelloArk`* variable can be accessed to know the author, size, content, hash, and if allowed grants the ability to execute it.
