## Mirror

**M**irror is the action of relaying the same transaction across different blockchains - independent of the actual caller. This is mainly used by the __`0xAether`__ protocol in which any transaction send to the __`0xAetherHub`__ is not defined by actual transaction parameters, but rather what the on-chain verification deems it to be.

## OR

## Reply

**R**eply is the action of sequential processing of a combination of sub-routines defined by the __`server`__ file, with a trigger that the loop will listen to and call the reply.



### Top-Level 

Each _Mirror_ is a _Reply_. However, not every _Reply_ is a _Mirror_ .
