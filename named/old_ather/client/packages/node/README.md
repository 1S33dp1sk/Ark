0xAether is a blockchain messaging space that establishes a standard for IO transactional messages between different protocols. Currently, it supports all `EVM` compatible chains, such as ethereum, binance, polygon and a few more. The 0xAether enables native on-chain messaging across different chainIds, with a slightly enhanced security as the consensus is done on-chain, but also seamlessly as the validation is checked on the fly against each transaction. While non-technical users can enjoy and utilize the functionality of initiating transactions without the knowledge of different networks and their standards, technical users have the privilage of full suite of contracts, tools, and plugins to create complete and complex multi-chain & cross-chain dApps and contract-logic. Any transaction can be inititated and finalized through the aether from deployment, transfers, launching and much more; Regardless of the chainId or the contract deployment state (i.e: if it has already been deployed or not). The 0xAether as a project is trusted and community-driven.

Technical users: Check the different between Cross-Chain && Multi-Chain. https://wwww.aetherlabs.io/guides#Cross-Chain-Calls

Overview for everyone: https://wwww.aetherlabs.io/



Enabling Cross-Chain-Calls : Swap BSC only tokens to ETH only tokens using CCCs

Enabling Multi-Chain-Calls : Have your NFTs with their Ids across different chains and NFT contract address the same on everychain instead of having duplicates and/or fakes.
