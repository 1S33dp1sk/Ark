# Ark Programming Language

Discover Ark, a programming language promoting a universal programming language & the resulting integrations.

## Core of Ark's System Architecture( IXR, MOD, LBB and ATP )

At the core of Ark there are modules which are included in a build-defined charms, there are 4 different charms in ark:

## *`lbb` charm* '**Storage**'

- [**LBBs (Linked Binary Books)**](./.@/k512/lbb) enables distributed storage initialization through the `dPRG(LBB)` function, which creates a default 1200-byte shared memory and the coressponding addresses associated with the initator and the process. 

## *`out` charm* '**Executable**'

- [**ATP (Ark Terminal Protocol)**](./.@/k512/atp) is a versatile feature that takes a single argument, an execution string, and evaluates it based on the  input. ATP can serve multiple purposes based on its identifiers:

## *`src` charm* '**Compile**'

- [**IXRs (Image Execution Runners)**](./.@/k512/ixr) provides the runtime source code needed for compiling binary images for different architectures, enabling seamless integration of executables from other hosts and other languages such as Python or JavaScript.     

## *`run` charm* '**Alpha**'

- [**MODs (short for modifications)**](./.@/mods) Pseudo-variable objects, in which they can a combination of different types such as executables, immutables, compilables or oridinary extensions files.     


#### Notables :)

*Ark's syntax makes these capabilities possible, offering developers an unparalleled tool for building efficient and reliable applications.* -- Timothy S.
