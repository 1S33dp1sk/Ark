# ather processors always have 2 or more point{s,ers} a tracker of the type 
# and a tracker for the referenced execution params, notice here that execution
# params include binaries, ternaries, and any new numbering system&|encoding 
# including two or more step executions such as compile, link & run using a combination of 
# `cc`, `[ar,nm, cc -fpic]` , `./` 
#in general the following:
	# `./shared/programs/[interpreter:python3,node,sh,...] args..` 

# a 2nd level ather processor can be fully connected on a full grid, with max bit change being the 
# correct amount of balance between latency and complete change.
# the type of, defined for this, is ternary which is 3. it's VERY important to note that 3 means,
# 3 different `ent`|entities in the ather processor and not the same ather processor into more than 1,
# it's also very important to note that the ather processor is always changing but 1 change at a time
# and that's the charm.

# a 3rd level ather processor can relay latency and change to other ather processors connected on the
# athernet.
#	the athernet uses blockchain for historical data, the internet to connect, ternary for lockation, binary to execute \

# an athernet processor is able to define itself or mimic any other type of athernet processor, nonetheless
# a processor is not limited, except by it's balance. Unlike in the traditional sense the hardware is the limitation, 
# no sir, 
# a device running athernet can execute commands comming from processors that it's not running on, as a vik, 
# and each vic contributes xol to get the { cpu , gpu } execution to the output device, as an optimization 
# technique: threads stacks & heaps can be decreased to yeild a slower_t of of delivery and execution.
# the amount,lockation,latency of the combined laddr vars in the processors that run any charm response determines
# a part of that charm.
