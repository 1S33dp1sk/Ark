## Ark

Ark is a programming language developed mostly by utilizing the C89 & C99, and some header files.    

The primary focus of the language is to be able to design responsive isolated system and system calls. Utilizing a virtual architicture control fairly simply, making batch script processing and large data handling a little easier. 

Ark is most notibly known for the *inpar* variables, unlike traditional type cast initialization, Ark uses spc(single-process-chain) variables, which are entire process chains that can be  programmed, compilied, exported, executed, scheduled and limited.

### Features

some are already defined :
	`cool types == cool features` 

1. program
```ark
	program(alpha, IXR&->base.py)
```
which will call **base.py** in the path *@charms:d.run*

2. variable

```ark
	string(var_name, "Hello World\n")
	pointer(ptr_name, 512)
```
3. input/output:
```ark
	out(var_name)
	__TEXT(Hello World)
``` 
*NOTE : running 2&3 will display the output `Hello World` on what is known as `out(0)` which is essentially `stdout` in c, and more generally in the Controlling Terminal.*

as script processors:
	script(@mods/script_name)



a `d_` type can be defined to customize new types,


 utilizing the ability of nesting types and function declaration, essentially the data type of any language can be added on the fly as you can apply nesting through ark calls.
