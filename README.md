Let me run you through the reason, distributed systems and decentralization are very important. During the development of centralized systems such as the ones we see today, there has been massive improvments in the sectors revolving around that, with little to none in other broad areas that if explored can sum up to a more effecient process. 

Furthermore, if we consider the grand scheme of things, we can speculate that if we have an *improvment function* `I( x , theta )` that applies on a certain input **x** and that varies with time **theta** hit a "local" threshold, in normal technological terms, the amount of improvments based on the current level of technology in it's sole spectrum is not as profitable as trying to decrease **x** to `s( x_les )` where a different *improvment function* can be applied on 

`s` to yeild :: 
	`I_1( I_2( x_les , theta_les ) , theta )`


&& *profitable* here is in terms of opportinuity cost.

=======
### @point check

every @point must have a FIFO in a known directory with WR permissions and accessiable


### /path check

every /path/to/file must have return true using `__sys_entry` which essentially calls `stat` from 
```c
#include <sys/stat.h>
```
and checks the user-id , group-id , etx.


### local\global.ip.address check

every **DNS** name should resolve to a *global.ip.address* and every *global.ip.address* should return the ***@point*** associated with it.


### blockchain-0xaddr check

every **blockchain address** should be resolved either by connecting to a local blockchain query or via checking the blockchain using a client. ather implementation here is to follow with the query until the end of the resolvment. So for example `ethereum` can be queried via a local *geth* client or any other, and bitcoin blockchain can query the extradata used in the transaction, as well as solana and anyother.

- mainly utilizing any type of free logging to formulate an **ather call*((*))**
