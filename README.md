Let me run you through the reason, distributed systems and decentralization are very important. During the development of centralized systems such as the ones we see today, there has been massive improvments in the sectors revolving around that, with little to none in other broad areas that if explored can sum up to a more effecient process. 

Furthermore, if we consider the grand scheme of things, we can speculate that if we have an *improvment function* `I( x , theta )` that applies on a certain input **x** and that varies with time **theta** hit a "local" threshold, in normal technological terms, the amount of improvments based on the current level of technology in it's sole spectrum is not as profitable as trying to decrease **x** to `s( x_les )` where a different *improvment function* can be applied on 

`s` to yeild :: 
	`I_1( I_2( x_les , theta_les ) , theta )`


&& *profitable* here is in terms of opportinuity cost.

# 0xather *@-Protocol*

## A simple overview

The ather is a multi-front protocol paradigm. It is used as a secure execution context channel between different CPU architicutres, networks, and machines. The protocol is hardware-independent and dynamically adaptive based on:

1. processors bit-count. 

2. type of connection.

3. ather name.


## A simple call

Whilst creating an application to be used on top of the ather is completely up to the developers, the main result of the functionality provided by the ather is simple, that is to ensure **0.0%** packet loss, and to create a communication plug that allows for executables to be run independently with variable arguments, only by the allowed parties in any given context. 

## A simple network

The security of the network and the integerity of the data transfered is guaranteed by a relay of P2P networks with a *Precautionary Tail*. That acts as a safe-fall-back mechanism for any interuption in a **LES** connection ( where any of the links is dubbed `connectionLES` ). 


## A simple integeration

The ather can be integerated
